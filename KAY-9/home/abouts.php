      How do we conduct our product reviews?
      </h3>

      <div class="blog-post">
        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Safety</h2>
        

        <p>The health and safety of your pet is our first priority. We test and review products keeping these two things in mind. If we notice any issues with the product during the test and feel it is not safe the pet, we do not recommend it at all.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Comfort</h2>
        

        <p>The next important thing we consider while testing is how the product feels in the hands. Is it comfortable to hold and easy to use?  Any product that is not designed to fit comfortably in your hands has the risk of damaging your muscles. Along with your pet, your health is also important.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Performance</h2>
        

        <p>A very basic but extremely important feature that we look for in the product is its high standard of performance. If the performance is not up to our expectations, we would never recommend that product.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="blog-post-title">User Experience</h2>
        

        <p>We also take the customer service of the brand we are reviewing into consideration. If we come across customers speaking about unsatisfactory customer service then we make a note of it.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Quality and Reliability</h2>
        

        <p>In this category we are looking for things such as, what material is this product made of, can it be damaged easily, and does it have battery issues and all other technical credentials.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>You do get lots of information on the internet about pet grooming products but that information is not specific to your pet’s breed. Here we base our reviews on the basis of pet’s breed. We pick products that are best for different breeds. We keep each breed’s unique needs in mind and review the products that specifically suit their needs.</p>
        
        
        <h3>We know the importance of choosing the right products for your pets</h3>
